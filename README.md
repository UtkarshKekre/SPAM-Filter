# SPAM-Filter
Out motive is to build a spam detection engine. So out system should be able to classify a given mail as spam or not-spam. This is the classification problem as the outcome should be either 0 for no spam and 1 for spam. So, if the SVM analyses a single email it will return a 0 or 1. We get our data from UCI Machine Learning Repository. This is called "Spambase" data set.
